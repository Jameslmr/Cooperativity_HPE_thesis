# Cooperativity_HPE_thesis

Collection of scripts used in "The cooperative transitions of hydrophobic polyelctrolytes" PhD thesis written by James L. Martin Robinson.

The scripts included in this repository are included here in an effort to increase the reproducibility of the work included in my PhD thesis: https://doi.org/10.33540/2534 .

The scripts are ordered in folders reflecting which chapter they appear in. The scripts used to analyze unpublished data have not been included for now. We intend to update this repository when we produce a preprint including this data, which will be submitted to a publication archive!

I want to stress that the intention is not to provide a good example on how such scripts should be written as the general quality of the scripts is low.
